# CloakPipe — Implementation Plan (v2)

## Guiding Principles

1. **Ship the proxy first, CloakTree second.** The proxy + regex detection is the foundation everything else builds on.
2. **CloakTree is the differentiator.** Get it to v0.2 quickly — no competitor has vectorless privacy-first retrieval.
3. **Vault correctness is non-negotiable.** Encryption, consistency, and memory safety right in v0.1.
4. **Feature-gate aggressively.** Default build = regex + vault + proxy. Everything else is opt-in.
5. **Don't attempt TEE, ADCPE, and bijection simultaneously.** Each is a deep project.

## What Changed from V1 Plan

| V1 Phase | V2 Phase | Change |
|----------|----------|--------|
| v0.1: Foundation (weeks 1-3) | v0.1: Foundation (weeks 1-3) | Unchanged |
| v0.2: RAG Pipeline (weeks 4-6) | v0.2: **CloakTree** (weeks 4-7) | Swapped — CloakTree is the headline feature |
| v0.3: NER (weeks 7-10) | v0.3: CloakVector + Streaming (weeks 8-10) | V1's v0.2 scope moved here |
| v0.4: Hardening (weeks 11-14) | v0.4: NER + ADCPE (weeks 11-14) | Added vector encryption |
| v0.5: Ecosystem (weeks 15-20) | v0.5: Local-First + TEE (weeks 15-20) | New scope entirely |

**Rationale**: CloakTree is the unique differentiator. Shipping it in v0.2 means we have something no competitor offers by week 7. CloakVector (the v1 pipeline) is still important but becomes v0.3.

## Deferred (Post v0.5)

These are real capabilities but should not distract from v0.1-v0.5:

| Feature | Reason to Defer |
|---------|----------------|
| Token bijection (AlienLM) | Requires fine-tuning API, niche audience |
| Vision-based CloakTree | Depends on multimodal model capabilities |
| Browser extension (WASM) | Distribution play, not core product |
| Compliance reports (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR) | Enterprise sales feature, not dev adoption |
| Intel TDX / NVIDIA Confidential GPU | Nitro first, others later |
| Covariant obfuscation (AloePri) | Requires model weight access |
| Activation steering (PrivacyRestore) | Research-stage, requires model internals |

---

## Risk Register (v2)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Streaming rehydration edge cases | High | High | Fuzz testing, configurable buffer, timeout flush |
| CloakTree: poor tree quality on unstructured docs | High | Medium | Clear documentation: CloakTree for structured docs only |
| CloakTree: search quality with weak local models | High | Medium | Default to external LLM; local is opt-in |
| ADCPE: incorrect crypto implementation | Medium | Critical | Use published reference implementation, get crypto review |
| Scope creep: 8 crates too ambitious | High | High | Feature-gate everything, ship core first |
| Vault corruption on crash | Medium | Critical | Atomic writes, write-ahead intent log |
| PageIndex license/IP issues | Low | High | Verify MIT/Apache license, CloakTree is inspired-by not fork |
| Dataiku ships production code before us | Medium | Medium | CloakTree is unique — Dataiku won't have vectorless mode |
