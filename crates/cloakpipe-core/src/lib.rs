//! CloakPipe Core — Detection, pseudonymization, and rehydration engine.
//!
//! This crate provides the foundational privacy primitives:
//! - Multi-layer entity detection (regex, financial, NER, custom rules)
//! - Consistent pseudonymization with stable entity→token mappings
//! - Encrypted mapping vault (AES-256-GCM + zeroize)
//! - Response rehydration (including SSE streaming support)
